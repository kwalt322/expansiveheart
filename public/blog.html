			<p>In this bite-sized blog post, I discuss three essential practices for the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) to maintain calm amidst the busyness of life. </p>
			<img class="rightimg" src="images/secondary_woman.png">

			<p>If navigating graduate school and starting a therapy practice has taught me anything, it is how to be a busy Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) while maintaining balance.  Due to our enhanced perception and emotional capacity, HSPs have the ability to be extremely detail-oriented and love to immerse ourselves deeply in our work or caring for our loved ones.  However, unless we have adequate amounts of quiet time to decompress, we are often left exhausted and overstimulated by a demanding schedule.  Below are a few essential practices that I use to reduce anxiety and overstimulation while happily checking off my to-do list. </p>

			<p>
				<b>Allow Quiet</b> to be Part of Your Routine: <br/>
Find Quiet moments throughout the day to DO NOTHING.  Even 5 minutes makes a big impact.  Sit in the bathroom or car in between activities, lay in the dark, lounge outside or take advantage of whatever quiet space you have access to.  In these moments, simply notice your breath, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.  HSPs are easily overstimulated by too much stimuli, so by giving your nervous system time to decompress and your mind time to slow down, you can reduce your overall stress load.  
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Breath Breaks</b> are Essential: <br/>
Take 30 second breath breaks in between tasks or anytime you feel anxious, stressed or overwhelmed.  Slowly breathe in through your nose and then exhale even more slowly through pursed lips (like you are blowing a bubble).  Do this several times until you feel more relaxed.  Slowing the exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system and immediately starts to destress your body.   
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Compartmentalize</b> Your To-Do List:<br/>
Organize your to-do list into a daily, weekly and monthly schedule.  Then, prioritize the tasks for today and forget about the rest.  By focusing on one task at a time, you can reduce your overall level or worry. 
			</p>

			<p>
			No matter what you do, be a master of your own self-care.  
What would feel absolutely delicious to do for yourself this week?

				Three Simple Practices to Ease Overstimulation at Work
			</a>
		</button>

			<p>Do you struggle to concentrate at work, feel overwhelmed by what&rsquo;s expected of you or leave feeling exhausted? Let&rsquo;s face it, Introverts and Highly Sensitive People often find work to be overwhelming and exhausting.  We have a tendency to be easily overstimulated by sensory stimulation (noise, bright lights, social interaction, etc.) and need more time to process our thoughts or make decisions.  Put us in an open-office plan, fast paced environment or give us a demanding schedule and the workplace becomes stressful and potentially even unmanageable for quiet, sensitive types.  Changing work environments or careers is not always an option, so what do you do?</p>
			<p>Below are three simple practices to help you cope as an Introvert or Highly Sensitive Person at work:</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>1. Take Mindfulness Breaks</b><br/> 
				Take 30 seconds to pause between each meeting, project or activity:  Feel your feet on the ground, your body in your seat and take three slow deep breaths.  Inhale through the nose and exhale as you purse your lips (like you are blowing out birthday candles).  This slows down your breathing and activates a calming response. </p>
				<p class="indent"><img class="star" src="images/star_blue.png"><u>Pro Tip:</u> Try this technique next time you are feeling stressed in a meeting or while stuck in a crowded commute.  </p>  
			

			<p class="indent">Take your lunch break without checking email or looking at your phone.  This allows you to slow down and give your mind a chance to rest.  Breaks can be taken alone or with a close friend, depending on your needs.  For instance, if you&rsquo;ve had a day full of meetings you may need a quieter lunch. </p>


			<p class="indent"><b>2. Find Quiet Refuge</b><br/>
				Find a quiet space to use when you need to recharge.  This could be a break room, unoccupied conference room, nearby park, your car or even the restroom.  Finding short moments of quiet throughout the day can help maintain energy levels overall. </p>

				<p class="indent"><img class="star" src="images/star_blue.png"><u>Pro Tip:</u>Fresh air and movement enhance the experience. </p>

				<p class="indent"><b>3. Set Firm Boundaries</b><br/>
				Don&rsquo;t answer any unnecessary personal phone calls or e-mails while at work.  Staying single-mindedly focused will help maintain balanced stimulation levels rather than worrying about everything at once. 
				</p>
				<p class="indent">Maintain solid boundaries with co-workers.  Correspond through email when possible and turn down lunch invitations if you&rsquo;re feeling too drained.  Finding a balance of connection and personal space is key.  </p>

				<p class="indent"><img class="star" src="images/star_blue.png"><u>Pro Tip:</u>It&rsquo;s actually okay to put yourself first and say &ldquo;no&rdquo; sometimes. </p>

				<p>By incorporating more quiet moments of self-care into our daily routine and maintaining personal boundaries with coworkers, Introverts and Highly Sensitive People can more easily manage the demands of work.  What are other ways you can reduce your level of stimulation and increase your productivity at work? </p>

				<p><b>If you are feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated at work, therapy can be a great support to help you reduce stress and increase self-care.  </b></p>

				Blissfully Barefoot: My Story of Being a Highly Sensitive Person
			</a>

			<p>I walk around barefoot as much as possible and find great satisfaction in being able to come home and take my socks off!  As a child, one of my first memories was my extreme dislike of wearing socks.  I always could feel the seams on my toes, the sensation incessantly irritating and distracting.  I didn&rsquo;t understand why I was so fussy about it and my caregivers would get frustrated with me for taking so long to get my shoes on.  When I read that &ldquo;[highly sensitive children] were more bothered by &hellip; the seams in socks&rdquo; in Elaine Aron&rsquo;s book, Psychotherapy and the Highly Sensitive Person (p. 35), I literally broke down in tears. </p>
			<p>Growing up, I never felt understood.  I always felt more fragile, more sensitive, more quiet, more concerned about others, and more emotional than anyone else I knew.  I cried when I saw trees being cut down to make space for a convenience store near my house.  I would stare at the rain for hours, feeling completely entranced and captivated by the natural wonder.  It took me months to transition to a new classroom each school year.  I suffered from autoimmune issues, and my body is very sensitive to stress.  I always felt different, but I didn&rsquo;t know why.  That is until I discovered more about my sensitive temperament and learned to embrace its gifts.</p>
			<p>You may be wondering&hellip;</p>
			<p><b>What exactly is High Sensitivity?</b><br/>       
				According to research by Elaine Aron, High Sensitivity is an innate trait found in 15-20% of humans, equally dispersed among all gender identities.  It is a variation that allows the nervous system and brain to process subtleties and details that most miss.  This once lifesaving evolutionary tool has become an overstimulating burden in the modern world where there are high amounts of stimuli to process at all times.  (Aron, 2010)</p>
				<p><b>How do I know if I am a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)?<br/></b> 
					High Sensitivity can manifest in many ways, although below are some common experiences of HSPs: </p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>Compared to others, you tend to feel events more deeply and for longer periods of time.  Perhaps you are the first to cry during a movie or have vivid dreams that will linger with you for days.</li>
					<li>You feel easily flustered or overwhelmed in many areas of your life.  This could show up as general anxiety, chronic digestive issues, exhaustion, poor concentration or lowered immune functioning.  Even pleasant experiences can be stressful such as transitioning into a new relationship or living situation.  </li>
					<li>You experience a high level of empathy for others and perhaps even take on others&rsquo; feelings as if they were your own. </li>
					<li>You think deeply and often consider the long-term effects of your decisions before moving forward.  You could describe yourself as conscientious and perhaps perfectionistic.  </li>
					<li>Certain types of external stimuli bother you.  This could include bright lights, loud noises, social stimulation, crowded buses, quickly flashing movie screens, strong smells and/or rough textures.  You cover your ears when an ambulance or fire engine passes by, often cut the tags out of your clothing, and/or feel hyped from consuming caffeine or dark chocolate. </li>
					<li>You notice little details that others may miss, such as subtle body language or small changes to an environment.  You are the first to notice if your friend gets a new haircut or if someone is upset.  </li>
					<li>Small talk is dissatisfying and perhaps boring to you.  Relationships are very important, so you dive in quickly and feel more connected with someone only when they get vulnerable or emotional.  </li>
				</ul>
