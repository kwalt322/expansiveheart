				<h2 class="display-mobile">Highly Sensitive Persons (HSP)</h2>
				<p>The term &ldquo;Highly Sensitive Person&rdquo;, was coined by Dr. Elaine Aron to describe people who process sensory data more deeply, feel intensely and notice small details that others may miss. </p>
				<p>You may be a Highly Sensitive Person if any of the following statements apply to you:</p>
				<div class="list">
					<ul>
						<li>Feel differently from others or have been told you are &ldquo;too sensitive&rdquo;.</li>
						<li>Are easily overstimulated or overwhelmed by noise, light, crowds, deadlines, etc.</li>
						<li>Experience positive and negative emotions intensely.</li>
						<li>Transitions and sudden changes to routine can be upsetting or stressful. </li> 
						<li>You are hyper-aware of your impact on others.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Allow me to help you manage the difficulties of being highly sensitive and discover the many gifts of this trait.  Together we can learn ways to manage stimulation through self-soothing techniques, create strategies for self-care, and process emotions and the impact of their intensity.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
				<h2 class="display-mobile">Healing &amp; Personal Growth</h2>
				<p>Often we lack the level of care, connection and understanding we need as children or as adults in intimate relationships.  As a result, we can feel as if something is missing or we aren&rsquo;t where we want to be. </p>
				<p>Do you struggle with any of the following?</p>
				<div class="list">
					<ul>
						<li>You put the needs of others first or feel guilty for taking care of yourself. </li>
						<li>As a child, you felt misunderstood or did not have your needs met by caregivers. </li>
						<li>Your childhood home was dysfunctional, chaotic or traumatic due to presence of addiction, abuse, compulsivity, instability, absence of caregivers and/or other factors. </li>
						<li>It is difficult to manage or understand your emotions. </li> 
						<li>You struggle with intimate relationships.</li>
						<li>You are really hard on yourself or have low self-esteem. </li> 
						<li>You have an insatiable need for approval and love. </li>
					</ul>
				</div> 

				<p>If you experience any or all of the struggles above, you aren&rsquo;t alone.  I understand how challenging it can be to not feel at peace within yourself or relationships.  Without a proper model, it can be difficult to establish healthy patterns in relationships and learn to take care of ourselves.  I would be honored to support you in learning to express your needs and begin to speak to yourself in a more compassionate way.  </p>
				<p>Let&rsquo;s work together to uncover and ease your suffering.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
				<h2 class="display-mobile">Relationships</h2>
				<p>Being in relationship with another can be difficult and often brings up our biggest insecurities and fears of loss.</p>
				<p>Do any of the following statements sound familiar?</p>
				<div class="list">
					<ul>
						<li>You feel disconnected from your partner or yourself while in relationship. </li>
						<li>The same fight keeps happening over and over. </li>
						<li>You find yourself attracted to the same types of partners. </li>  
						<li>The more you need your partner, the more they pull away. </li>
						<li>You feel smothered by your partner.  </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Whether you want to work alone or alongside your significant other, I can help you explore the feelings behind the conflict, learn to navigate conflict more skillfully, communicate more effectively and feel closer to one another.</p>
				<p>I welcome individuals and couples of all sexual orientations and identities.</p>

				<h2 class="display-mobile">Groups</h2>
				<p>
					Groups can be a helpful alternative or addition to individual therapy, as a way to gain support in community and learn coping skills.  Groups typically consist of about 4-6 people and meet once per week for two hours. 
				</p> 
				<p>
					At this time, I offer the following groups: 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Too Sensitive? Navigating High Sensitivity and Emotional Overwhelm</b> 
					<span class="lighten">Starting in Fall 2016</span><br/>
					Gain support from a small community of other Highly Sensitive Persons and learn practical tools to cope with emotional overwhelm and overstimulation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sensing into Mindfulness - An Experiential Learning Group</b><br/>
					Cultivated self-awareness through basic mindfulness practices and exploration of the five senses through weekly experiential exercises such as self-massage and guided visualization. <br/>
					Past Participants rated this group overall:  
					<img class="star" src="images/star_blue.png">
